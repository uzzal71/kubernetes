ReplicaSet - 7
Introduction: Let us now link the pods to the ReplicaSet by updating selectors. 

Instruction: Add a property "matchLabels" under selector and copy the labels defined in the pod-definition under it. 

Note: This may not work in play-with-k8s as it runs on 1.8 version of kubernetes. ReplicaSets moved to apps/v1 in 1.9 version of Kubernetes.
