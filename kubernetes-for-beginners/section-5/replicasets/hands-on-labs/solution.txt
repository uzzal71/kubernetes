1. How many PODs exist on the system?
   In the current(default) namespace.
--> kubectl get pods

2. How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?
   In the current(default) namespace.
--> kubectl get replicaset

3. How about now? How many ReplicaSets do you see?
   We just made a few changes!
--> kubectl get replicaset

4. How many PODs are DESIRED in the new-replica-set?
--> kubectl get replicaset

5. What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set?
--> kubectl describe replicaset new-replica-set

6. How many PODs are READY in the new-replica-set?
--> kubectl get replicaset

7. Why do you think the PODs are not ready?
--> kubectl describe pod new-replica-set

8. Delete any one of the 4 PODs?
--> kubectl get pods
--> kubectl delete pod new-replica-set-wkzjh

9. How many pods exis now?
--> kubectl get pods

10. Why are there 4 PODs, even after you deleted one?
--> ReplicaSet ensures that desired number of PODs always run

11. Create a ReplicaSet using the replicaset-definition-1.yaml file located at /root/.
    There is an issue with the file, so try to fix it.
--> ls /root
replicaset-definition-1.yaml  replicaset-definition-2.yaml sample.yaml

--> kubectl create -f /root/replicaset-definition-1.yaml
error: unable the recognize "/root/replicaset-definition-1.yaml": no match for kind "ReplicaSet" in version "v1"

--> cat /root/replicaset-definition-1.yaml
--> kubectl explain replicaset

Update apiVersion: apps/v1

--> kubectl create -f /root/replicaset-definition-1.yaml

12. Fix the issue in the replicaset-definition-2.yaml file and create a ReplicaSet using it.
    The file is located at /root/.
--> ls /root
replicaset-definition-1.yaml  replicaset-definition-2.yaml sample.yaml

--> kubectl create -f /root/replicaset-definition-2.yaml

Update labels

--> kubectl create -f /root/replicaset-definition-2.yaml

13. Delete the two newly created ReplicaSets - replicaset-1 and replicaset-2
--> kubectl get rs
--> kubectl delete rs replicaset-1
--> kubectl delete rs replicaset-2

14. Fix the original replica set new-replia-set to
   use the corrent busybox image
   Either delete and recreate the ReplicaSet or Update
   the existing ReplicaSet and then delete all PODs, so
   new ones with the correct image will be created.
--> kubectl edit rs new-replicaset-set

Update image

--> kubectl get pods
--> kubectl get rs
--> kubectl describe rs
--> kubectl delete pod new-replicaset-vpkh8
--> kubectl get pods
--> kubectl get rs

15. Scale the ReplicaSet to 5 PODs
    use kubectl scale command or edit the
    replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset.
--> kubectl scale rs new-replica-set --replicas=5
--> kubectl get pods
--> kubectl edit rs new-replica-set

16. Now scale the ReplicaSet down to 2 PODs.
    use kubectl scale command or edit the
    replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset.
--> kubectl edit rs new-replica-set
--> kubectl get pods
